      <p className="pb-4 m-2">
        I am deeply passionate about IT and coding, with my expertise honed at
        Noroff, where I specialized in Frontend development, and through my
        Bachelor's degree in Design. While studying at Noroff, I also took on
        freelance projects in 3D BIM. My main drive for applying to this
        position lies in my desire to enhance creativity and user-friendliness.
      </p>
      <p className="pb-4 m-2">
        Before venturing into IT, I predominantly worked in architectural firms.
        My last role was at Enerhaugen Arkitektkontor AS, where I served as a
        BIM/technical draftsman. Colleagues often describe me as an optimistic,
        social, and enthusiastic team player.

        willingness to go above and beyond. I possess a quick learning ability
        and can adapt seamlessly to diverse situations and work environments. I
        am dedicated to working hard to achieve my goals.
      </p>
      <p className="pb-4 m-2">
        My aspiration is to work within a highly skilled and experienced team,
        where opportunities for development and active engagement in a positive
        work environment are valued. I am confident that I will find these
        qualities within your organization.
